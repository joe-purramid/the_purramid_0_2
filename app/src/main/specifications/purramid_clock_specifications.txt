Clock is a collection of timekeeping services that allows teachers to demonstrate how time works across the globe. It creates a digital or analog clock to manage classroom time.

 --- RUNTIME EVENTS ---
(1) On first app-intent launch, the clock opens in a windowed state.
(2) The most recent clock user preferences are saved. Save the following:
	(2.1) Clock size
    (2.2) Clock face color
	(2.3) 24-hour toggle state
	(2.4) Current time zone
	(2.5) Seconds toggle state
	(2.6) All user-created alarms
		(2.6.1) Alarms are saved whether they are active or not.
		(2.6.2) Active alarms remain active on next app launch.
	(2.7) Clock position on the screen if not full-screen
(3) On future app-intent launches, the clock loads saved user preferences.


 --- USER INTERFACE ---
(4) A Settings button is positioned in the bottom left corner.
	(4.1) Default icon state uses ic_settings.xml.
	(4.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080.
(5) A Close button is positioned in the top right corner.
	(5.1) Default icon state uses ic_close.xml.
	(5.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080.

(6) A clock face appears in the middle of the window
	(6.1) The face can be one of two types:

``ANALOG``
		(6.1.1) A circular analog clock with the following components:
			(6.1.1.1) Numbers 1 - 12 ordered around the interior circumference of the circle
				(6.1.1.1.1) A second series of numbers, 13 - 24, can be turned on in the settings.
				(6.1.1.1.2) 12-hour clock face: clock_face.xml
				(6.1.1.1.3) 24-hour clock face: clock_face24.xml
					(6.1.1.1.3.1) TODO: Confirm accuracy. Is a 24-hour view programmatically added to clock_face.xml?
			(6.1.1.2) Four small tick marks between each number
			(6.1.1.3) One large tick mark aligned with each number
			(6.1.1.4) A second hand
				(6.1.1.4.1) This can be disabled in the settings.
			(6.1.1.5) A minute hand
			(6.1.1.6) An hour hand.

``DIGITAL``
		(6.1.2) A rectangular digital clock displayed as HH:MM:SS.
			(6.1.2.1) If seconds are turned off in settings, time is displayed HH:MM.
				(6.1.2.1.1) If the clock is set to 12-hour:
					(6.1.2.1.1.1) a leading zero is not included for hours between 1 - 9.
					(6.1.2.1.1.2) AM and PM appear following seconds.
						(6.1.2.1.1.2.1) They are stacked on top of one another, with AM on top and PM on the bottom.
						(6.1.2.1.1.2.2) When AM is active, PM is not shown.
						(6.1.2.1.1.2.3) When PM is active, AM is not shown.
				(6.1.2.1.2) If the clock is set to 24-hour:
					(6.1.2.1.2.1) Midnight is displayed as 00:00 (not 24:00)
					(6.1.2.1.2.2) a leading zero is included for hours between 0 - 9
	
	(6.2) Time passing is animated:
		(6.2.1) Analog hands rotate around the clock face
		(6.2.2) Digital numbers count upward
			
``BUTTONS``
(7) Below the clock face are two buttons:
	(7.1) Play/pause
		(7.1.1) Default state: ic_pause.xml
		(7.1.2) Active state: ic_play.xml
	(7.2) Reset
		(7.2.1) Default state: ic_reset.xml
		(7.2.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080
	(7.3) Play/Pause is on the left, and Reset is on the right.
		(7.3.1) This order is reversed for right-to-left languages.

``NESTED``
(8) A nested clock:
    (8.1) is reduced in size
        (8.1.1) An analog clock is 75px by 75px
        (8.1.2) A digital clock is 75px by 50px
    (8.2) is affixed to the top right corner of the screen
        (8.2.1) This includes 20px of padding so that the clock does not appear flush against the edge
    (8.3) does not have any (7) control buttons visible.
    (8.4) can still be moved or resized by the user with dragging or pinching actions, like normal.
    (8.5) is stacked if multiple nested clocks are added, with multiple clocks in the top right corner of the screen 
		(8.5.1) Nested clocks are are stacked one above the other, with the newest clock on the bottom.

``TIME ZONE DISPLAY``
(9) The time zone selection menu is an interactive 3D globe (scene.gltf)
	(9.1) An overlay divides the globe into time zone sections
	(9.2) Time zones are colored to better show their entire coverage space.
		(9.2.1) The current time zone is not colored
			(9.2.1.1) If not changed by the user, the current time zone matches the system time zone.
			(9.2.1.2) if changed by the user, the system clock settings do not affect the clock app-intent
		(9.2.2) Color overlays have 40% opacity
		(9.2.3) Time zones that are offset by 30 or 45 minutes have a striped coloring that matches the time zone on either side of them.
		(9.2.4) Time zone divisions change based on daylight saving time
			(9.2.4.1) For example, time zones that are UTC-3 may split in half when some of the countries move to daylight saving time and some don't. The color overlay would change at the time shift, with the some of those countries displaying the color for UTC-3 and some displaying UTC-2.
	(9.3) The top of the window includes: 
		(9.3.1) A back arrow in the top left corner of the window. 
			(9.3.1.1) Default icon state uses ic_back.xml.
			(9.3.1.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080.
			(9.3.1.3) When activated the time zone display closes.
				(9.3.1.3.1) The user returns to the main settings window.
		(9.3.2) A close button in the top right corner of the window.
			(9.3.2.1) Default icon state uses ic_close.xml.
			(9.3.2.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080.
			(9.3.2.3) When activated all settings related windows close.
	(9.4) Below the back arrow and close button and above the globe is listed two cities in that time zone.
		(9.4.1) City listings include:
			(9.4.1) City names
			(9.4.2) Country names
			(9.4.3) UTC offset
		(9.4.2) At least one city is in the northern hemisphere whenever possible.
		(9.4.3) At least one city is in the southern hemisphere whenever possible.
		(9.4.4) If only one city is available in that time zone, only one city is displayed.
		(9.4.5) If no cities are available in a time zone, that time zone is not represented on globe.
	(9.5) Each time zone includes two or more city pins 
		(9.5.1) At least one pin is in the northern hemisphere whenever possible.
		(9.5.2) At least one pin is in the southern hemisphere whenever possible.
        (9.5.3) City database entries include latitude and longitude
            (9.5.3.1) These values are not displayed to the user.
            (9.5.3.2) They are tracked to ensure accurate placement of the city pins.
	(9.6) Below the globe are:
		(9.6.1) a right-facing arrow
			(9.6.1.1) Default state: ic_arrow_right.xml
			(9.6.1.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080
		(9.6.2) a left-facing arrow
			(9.6.2.1) Default state: ic_arrow_left.xml
			(9.6.2.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080
		(9.6.3) a circle between the two arrows
			(9.6.3.1) Default state: ic_circle.xml

					(10.2.2.1.2.2) A thick blue bar beneath the icon
				(10.2.2.1.3) The default mode is (10.2.2.1.2.2) Digital
				(10.2.2.1.4) When a mode is activated:
					(10.2.2.1.4.1) The UI changes to that clock types
					(10.2.2.1.4.2) All other user settings are preserved
						(10.2.2.1.4.2.1) For example, a digital 24-hour clock changed to analog would display a 24-hour analog clock face.
			(10.2.2.2) "Colors"
				(10.2.2.2.1) Following the word "Color" is a color square
					(10.2.2.2.1.1) The fill for this square is the color current used for the clock face background
					(10.2.2.2.1.2) The default color is White.
				(10.2.2.2.2) If the user taps the word "Color" or the color square, a color picker opens.
				(10.2.2.2.3) The color picker displays the six color options from PurramidPalette.kt
					(10.2.2.2.3.1) This color applies to the clock face background
					(10.2.2.2.3.2) Clock hands and numbers are either black and white depending on which option creates the best color contrast with the background color.
			(10.2.2.3) "24-Hour"
				(10.2.2.3.1) Following the phrase "24-Hour" is an on/off toggle.
					(10.2.2.3.1.1) The toggle includes the strings "On" and "Off"
					(10.2.2.3.1.2) The default state is Off.	
				(10.2.2.3.2) If the setting is toggled on:
					(10.2.2.3.2.1) An analog clock displays a 24-hour clock face
					(10.2.2.3.2.2) A digital clock
						(10.2.2.3.2.2.1) displays time from 0 to 23 instead of 1-12
						(10.2.2.3.2.2.2) does not display AM/PM following the numeric time.
			(10.2.2.4) "Set Time Zone"
				(10.2.2.4.1) Following the phrase "Set Time Zone" is an edit button
					(10.2.2.4.1.1) Default state: ic_edit.xml
					(10.2.2.4.1.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080
				(10.2.2.4.2) If the user taps the phrase "Set Time Zone" or the edit button, the (9) Time Zone Display opens
					(10.2.2.4.2.1) This window is 750px by 750px
					(10.2.2.4.2.2) The time zone display window can be resized in the same manner as the clock window.
					(10.2.2.4.2.3) The globe can be moved
						(10.2.2.4.2.3.1) by press-hold-dragging a finger
							(10.2.2.4.2.3.1.1) The 3D globe image is spherical. Users may drag their finger in any direction
							(10.2.2.4.2.3.1.2) All time zones converge at the north and south poles.
						(10.2.2.4.2.3.2) by using the left or right arrows below the globe
							(10.2.2.4.2.3.2.1) Pressing the right arrow button advances the active time zone one time zone forward based on UTC offset
								(10.2.2.4.2.3.2.1.1) For example, the active time zone is UTC-5. Pressing the right arrow button will move the active time zone to UTC-4.
							(10.2.2.4.2.3.2.2) Pressing the left arrow button advances the active time zone one time zone backward based on UTC offset
								(10.2.2.4.2.3.2.2.1) For example, the active time zone is UTC-5. Pressing the left arrow button will move the active time zone to UTC-6.
							(10.2.2.4.2.3.2.3) Some time zones exist at intervals less than a full hour. When pressing left or right arrows:
								(10.2.2.4.2.3.2.3.1) Move to the next sequential time zone
									(10.2.2.4.2.3.2.3.1.1) For example, the active time zone is UTC+5. Pressing the right arrow changes the active time zone to UTC+5:30.
									(10.2.2.4.2.3.2.3.1.2) For example the active time zone is UTC+5:30. Pressing the right arrow changes the active time zone to UTC+5:45.
							(10.2.2.4.2.3.2.4) If there are multiple time zones with the same UTC offset, use the order set in the (10.2.2.4.2.4) database to define which time zone becomes active when pressing the left or right arrow buttons.
						(10.2.2.4.2.3.3) by pressing the circle between the left and right arrows
							(10.2.2.4.2.3.3.1) Pressing this button centers the globe on the current time zone.
					(10.2.2.4.2.4) UTC offset, city, and country information are included in a database.
                        (10.2.2.4.2.4.1) See ThePurramid01\app\src\main\assets\cities_timezones.csv
                        (10.2.2.4.2.4.2) See ThePurramid01\app\src\main\assets\time_zones.geojson
					(10.2.2.4.2.5) When a user taps on a time zone:
						(10.2.2.4.2.5.1) it becomes the active time zone
						(10.2.2.4.2.5.2) it no longer has a colored overlay
						(10.2.2.4.2.5.3) the previous active time zone has a colored overlay applied
			(10.2.2.5) "Seconds"
				(10.2.2.5.1) Following the word "Seconds" is an on/off toggle.
					(10.2.2.5.1.1) The toggle includes the strings "On" and "Off"

					(10.2.2.8.2.2) a new clock appears at the geometric center of the screen.
						(10.2.2.8.2.2.1) the new clock is offset 25px to the right and 25px down if a clock already exists at the center of the screen.
						(10.2.2.8.2.2.2) it adopts all the preferences of the clock from which it was opened
							(10.2.2.8.2.2.2.1) For example, a new clock opened from a 300px by 300px analog clock that has a light blue clock face would also be a 300px by 300px analog clock with a light blue clock face.
					(10.2.2.8.2.3) If four clocks already exist on the screen, the Add Another setting is inactivated.


 --- Non-Settings UX ---
(11) ``PLAY/PAUSE/RESET``
	(11.1) When a user taps the play/pause button while it is in its default state:
		(11.1.1) the icon changes to its active state
		(11.1.2) the time counting animation stops (is paused)
			(11.1.2.1) in analog mode, no hands move
			(11.1.2.2) in digital mode, no numbers change
	(11.2) When a user taps the play/pause button while it is in its active state:
		(11.2.1) the icon changes to its default state
		(11.2.2) time resumes counting (plays) from the point at which it was paused
			(11.2.2.1) For example, the user pauses time for 15 seconds at 10:05:15. When they press play, time resumes counting from 10:05:15.
	(11.3) When a user taps the reset button
		(11.3.1) the icon changes to its active state for the duration of the onTouch event
		(11.3.2) any time deficit from pausing is restored
			(11.3.2.1) For example the user paused time for 15 seconds at 10:05:15. When they press reset, the time shown changes to 10:05:30.
		(11.3.3) if time is paused
			(11.3.3.1) time remains paused
			(11.3.3.2) a new time deficit will accrue while the clock remains paused
		(11.3.4) if time is playing
			(11.3.4.1) time continues counting.
			
(12) ``MANUAL MANIPULATION``
	(12.1) When an analog clock is paused, a user can press-hold-drag the seconds, minute, or hour hands to change time.
		(12.1.1) Hands can be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise
		(12.1.2) Moving the minute hand also moves the seconds hand
			(12.1.2.1) The seconds hand moves as if time were passing.
			(12.1.2.2) For example, the user advances time three minutes. The seconds hand would complete three full rotations.
		(12.1.3) Moving the hour hand also moves the minute and seconds hand.
			(12.1.3.1) The minute and seconds hands move as if time were passing.
			(12.1.3.2) For example, the user reverses time one hour. The minute hand would complete one full rotation. The seconds hand would complete 60 rotations.
				(12.1.3.2.1) Given the speed at which the seconds hand will be moving, it is not necessary to show the hand pointing at every tick mark on the clock face.
	(12.2) If the user plays time after moving the clock hands, time resumes counting from the current time shown on the clock.
	(12.3) If the user resets time after moving the clock hands, behavior is the same as (11.3)
		(12.3.1) Surplus time accrued by advancing time would reset in the same fashion as a time deficit.
					
(13) ``CLOSE``
	(13.1) When a user touches the Close button, its icon changes from (5.1) Default to (5.2) Active.
	(13.2) The clock to which the Close button is attached closes.
		(13.2.1) When a clock is closed:
			(13.2.1.1) If it is the only clock currently open, its size, position (if not fullscreen), and settings selecitons are saved as the most recent user preferences, as per (2).
			(13.2.1.2) If it is one of multiple clocks currently open, its preferences are cleared.
		(13.2.2) If the clock is the only clock open, the clock service ends.


(14) TODO: Is "Enable Overlay" implemented correctly? It should be an auto-prompt and not a button.
