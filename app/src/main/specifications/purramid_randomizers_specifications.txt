		(6.1.4) There is one rectangle for every item on a list.
	(6.2) Each rectangle has a different color.
		(6.2.1) The rules for these colors are the same as (5.2).
	(6.3) Above each rectangle is a marquee.
		(6.3.1) Each marquee is placed on top of the containing rectangle.
		(6.3.2) These marquees are the same as (5.3) and (5.4).

		(7.1.2) Available dice are:
			(7.1.2.1) d4 (d4_result_blank.xml)
			(7.1.2.2) d6 (d6_result_blank.xml)
			(7.1.2.3) d8 (d8_result_blank.xml)
			(7.1.2.4) d10 (d10_result_blank.xml)
			(7.1.2.5) d% (dp_result_blank.xml)
				(7.1.2.5.1) This refers to percentile dice.
					(7.1.2.5.2) Percentile dice are two d10 dice.
						(7.1.2.5.2.1) The "ones" die uses numbers from 0 - 9
						(7.1.2.5.2.2) The "tens" die adds a 0 following the 0 - 9 numbers (00 - 90)
							(7.1.2.5.2.2.1) For example, a 1 on a "ones" d10 is 10 on a "tens" d10.
						(7.1.2.5.2.3) A percentile roll displays as a sum of the two dice.
							(7.1.2.5.2.3.1) For example, a roll of a 10 and a 1 is a roll of an 11.
							(7.1.2.5.2.3.2) 00+0 equals 100 and not 0.
				(7.1.2.5.2) Percentile dice are only included in the dice pool if they are turned on in the settings.

			(7.2.1.2) Percentile dice are not mixed with d10s.
		(7.2.2) spaced so that each group is distinct from the others.
			(7.2.2.1) Two die types would appear horizontally in the center of the window with a large amount of space between them.
			(7.2.2.2) Three die types would loosely form a triangle.
			(7.2.2.3) Four die types would loosely form a rectangle
			(7.2.2.4) Five die types would loosely form a pentagon
			(7.2.2.5) Six die types would loosely form a hexagon.
			(7.2.2.6) These shapes do not need to be exact, but offer a simple model for how to ensure space is available between each group of dice.
	(7.3) Below the display area are three buttons
		(7.3.1) Roll

				(8.1.1.1.2) colloqually referred to as b*
					(8.1.1.1.2.1) for example, 25 bits are b25
			(8.1.1.2) "Meatballs" are 
				(8.1.1.2.1) the equivalent of dollars in US dollars.

                (14.5.7.4.1) For example, 2d6 and 3d10 are rolled. The results are 3, 6 and 4, 4, 7. Two sums are displayed, 9 and 15.
            (14.5.7.5) If Sum by Type is toggled off, the results of all dice rolled are summed
                (14.5.7.5.1) For example, 2d6 and 3d10 are rolled. The results are 3, 6 and 4, 4, 7. The sum displayed is 24.
            (14.5.7.6) If modifiers have been applied in the "Add Modifiers" setting, that modifier is added to a sum for each instance of a die type included in the dice pool.
                (14.5.7.6.1) For example, if d6 has a modifier value of +2, the sums displayed in (14.5.7.4.1) would be 13 and 15.

				(14.5.10.5.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080
			(14.5.10.6) If a user taps the graph button:
				(14.5.10.6.1) The graph distribution button changes to its active state
				(14.5.10.6.2) A graph appears in the space where roll results are normally displayed.
					(14.5.10.6.2.1) (0,0) on the x-/y-axis never maps values. It creates a buffer between the axes and the plotted results.
					(14.5.10.6.2.2) The x-axis 
						(14.5.10.6.2.2.1) Is consistently positioned at the bottom of the graph.
						(14.5.10.6.2.2.2) Has an interval between axis values of 1f
						(14.5.10.6.2.2.3) Has interval labels for every number that can be rolled
							(14.5.10.6.2.2.3.1) For example, if a dice pool includes 1d6 and 2d20, the x-axis intervals range from 1 to 20.
							(14.5.10.6.2.2.3.2) If percentile dice are included, interval labels are increments of five.
								(14.5.10.6.2.2.3.2.1) For example, if a dice pool includes 1d6, 2d20, and 1d%, the x-axis intervals range from 5 to 100, in increments of five (making 20 total interval labels).
								(14.5.10.6.2.2.3.2.2) This will cause many results to be blotted not in line with an interval line. A result of 1 should be plotted 0.2f of the distance between 0 and 5.
					(14.5.10.6.2.3) The y-axis
						(14.5.10.6.2.3.1) Is consistently positioned at the side of the graph.
						(14.5.10.6.2.3.2) Has an interval between axis values of 1f
						(14.5.10.6.2.3.3) Has interval labels defined by this rule "If increment value = i and the maximum possible results = y, then i = y/50, with fractions rounded up to the next whole number."
							(14.5.10.6.2.3.3.1) If the distribution method is "manual", the maximum possible results is set to 20.
								(14.5.10.6.2.3.3.1.1) If the user exceeds 20 rolls while using manual distribution, the maximum possible results incdrease by 10.
								(14.5.10.6.2.3.3.1.2) Any time the user exceeds the current manual maximum value, increase the maximum value by 10.
								(14.5.10.6.2.3.3.1.3) If the user surpasses a maximum value of 50, interval labels should be listed in increments of 2 so that the y-axis never has more than 50 intervals.
							(14.5.10.6.2.3.3.2) If the distribution method is "normal", the maximum possible result is defined by (14.5.10.4.4.3).
								(14.5.10.6.2.3.3.2.1) For example, the default value of 1,000 would cause y-axis intervals to be 0 to 1000 in increments of 20.
									(14.5.10.6.2.3.3.2.1.1) This creates 50 intervals
									(14.5.10.6.2.3.3.2.1.2) There is no instance where the y-axis will have more than 50 intervals.
							(14.5.10.6.2.3.3.3) If the distribution method is "uniform", the maximum possible result is defined by (14.5.10.4.4.4).
								(14.5.10.6.2.3.3.3.1) For example, the default value of 1,000 would cause y-axis intervals to be 0 to 1000 in increments of 20.
									(14.5.10.6.2.3.3.3.1.1) This creates 50 intervals
									(14.5.10.6.2.3.3.3.1.2) There is no instance where the y-axis will have more than 50 intervals.
			(14.5.10.7) If a user taps the roll button while a graph distribution other than "Off" is selected:
				(14.5.10.7.1) The results are graphed on (14.5.10.6.2) graph lines.
					(14.5.10.1.1) If Manual distribution is selected:
						(14.5.10.1.1.1) The roll animation lasts for 0.5 seconds.
						(14.5.10.1.1.2) The result is plotted on the graph.
						(14.5.10.1.1.3) Additional rolls add additional results to the graph.
							(14.5.10.1.1.3.1) A Histogram bar lengthens every time that number is rolled as a result.
							(14.5.10.1.1.3.2) A Line Graph line adjusts upward to the new value every time that number is rolled as a result.
							(14.5.10.1.1.3.3) A new dot is added to the scatter plot for eery result rolled.
						(14.5.10.1.1.4) The roll animation does not need to complete for the user to press Roll again.
							(14.5.10.1.1.4.1) The roll animation continues for a total length of time equal to 0.5 seconds for every time the roll buttonw as pressed.
							(14.5.10.1.1.4.2) Results populate on the graph when their specific animation completes, even if additional roll animations are occuring.
					(14.5.10.1.2) If Normal distribution is selected:
						(14.5.10.1.2.1) The roll animation lasts for 3.0 seconds
						(14.5.10.1.2.2) A number of results equal to the value entered in (14.5.10.4.4.3) are plotted on the graph
							(14.5.10.1.2.2.1) Use a Box-Muller Transformation to generate normally distributed results.
						(14.5.10.1.2.3) Plotting should occur during the roll animation. All values should be plotted when the animation ends.
						(14.5.10.1.2.4) If the user presses the roll button a second time while the first distribution is calculating, the first roll is cancelled and a new roll begins.
					(14.5.10.1.3) If Uniform distribution is selected:
						(14.5.10.1.3.1) The roll animation lasts for 3.0 seconds.
						(14.5.10.1.3.2) A number of results equal to the value entered in (14.5.10.4.4.4) are plotted on the graph
						(14.5.10.1.3.3) Plotting should occur during the roll animation. All values should be plotted when the animation ends.
						(14.5.10.1.3.4) If the user presses the roll button a second time while the first distribution is calculating, the first roll is cancelled and a new roll begins.
					(14.5.10.1.4) If the graph distribution button is not active:
						(14.5.10.1.4.1) Graphing data are still retained.
						(14.5.10.1.4.2) Graphing data are displayed if the graph distribution button is activated.
						(14.5.10.1.4.3) If the graph distribution is returned to its default state, results continue to be graphed
							(14.5.10.1.4.3.1) These new results are displayed if the graph is active again.
						(14.5.10.1.4.4) It is the Graphing Distribution setting that determines whether results data are plotted, not whether the graph itself is visible or not.
				(14.5.10.7.2) Results are not differentiated by die type.
					(14.5.10.7.2.1) For example, if a dice pool includes 1d6 and 2d20 with roll results of 3, 11, and 17, the graph would plot points (3,1), (11,1), and (17,1).
					(14.5.10.7.2.2) TODO: Research whether to differentiate results by die type.


(15) ``COIN FLIP SPECIFIC UX``
    (15.1) If no preferences load on launch, the default coin pool is 1b25
		(15.1.1) Any coins in the coin pool show the heads side of that coin.
    (15.2) If a user taps the Flip button
		(15.2.1) The Flip icon changes to its active state
		(15.2.2) Using a pseudo-random number generator, determine the outcome for each coin in the pool.

					(15.4.2.3.1.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080
				(15.4.2.3.2) A text field that shows the quantity of that coin type currently in the coin pool
					(15.4.2.3.2.1) The default state would have b25 at 1 and all other coins at 0.
					(15.4.2.3.2.2) Tapping this text field opens the number pad.
				(15.4.2.3.3) A down arrow
					(15.4.2.3.3.1) Default state: ic_arrow_drop_down.xml

		(15.4.4) Tapping outside of the Coin Pool window closes the Coin Pool window.


``COIN FLIP MODE SETTINGS``
	(15.5) The settings window for Coin Flip mode includes these additional settings:
		(15.5.1) Each setting includes text and an icon.

``COLOR``
		(15.5.2) "Color" functions identially to (14.5.2), replacing dice with coins.
			(15.5.2.1) "Goldenrod" is the default color.

``FLIP ANIMATION``
		(15.5.3) "Flip Animation"
			(15.5.3.1) Following the phrase "Flip Animation" is an on/off toggle.
				(15.5.3.1.1) The toggle includes the strings "On" and "Off"
				(15.5.3.1.2) The default state is On.
			(15.5.3.2) If the setting is toggled off, flip results are shown immediately. There is no flip animation.

``FREE FORM``
		(15.5.4) "Free Form"
			(15.5.4.1) Following the phrase "Free Form" is an on/off toggle.
				(15.5.4.1.1) The toggle includes the strings "On" and "Off"
				(15.5.4.1.2) The default state is Off.
			(15.5.4.2) If the setting is toggled on:
                (15.5.4.2.1) All coins in the coin pool start on their heads (obverse) side.
                (15.5.4.2.2) The "Flip" button is replaced with a Tails button.
                    (15.5.4.2.2.1) Default state: b25_coin_flip_tails.xml
                    (15.5.4.2.2.2) Active state: b25_coin_flip_heads.xml
            (15.5.4.3) If the Tails button is pressed:
                (15.5.4.3.1) the button changes to its active state.
                (15.5.4.3.2) all coins on the screen change to their tails (reverse) side.
            (15.5.4.4) If a user taps an individual coin, that coin flips to the opposite face from what is shown.
                (15.5.4.4.1) If a coin has been individually flipped to its reverse side when the user taps a default tails button, that coin does not change its displayed face.
                (15.5.4.4.2) If a coin has been individually flipped to its obverse side when the user taps an aactive tails button, that coin does not change its displayed face.
            (15.5.4.5) If the user press-hold-drags a coin away from its default starting location, it moves to wherever the onTouch event ends.
                (15.5.4.5.1) This allows the teacher to organize coins in a pattern useful to their instruction, such as five different coins in a row.

``ANNOUNCE``
		(15.5.5) "Announce" functions identically to (14.5.6), replacing dice with coins.

``PROBABILITY``
        (15.5.6) "Probability"
			(15.5.6.1) This setting cannot be active while Announce is toggled on.
				(15.5.6.1.1) If this setting is toggled on when Announce is toggled on, Announce is toggled off.
				(15.5.6.1.2) If this setting is then toggled off, Announce remains toggled off.
            (15.5.6.2) Following the word "Probability" is a drop-down arrow.
			(15.5.6.2.1) The drop-down arrow's default state is ic_arrow_drop_down.xml
			(15.5.6.2.2) The drop-down arrow's active state is ic_arrow_drop_up.xml
		(15.5.6.3) If the user taps the word "Mode" or the drop-down arrow
			(15.5.6.3.1) A drop-down menu opens that displays a probability selection window (similar to (14.5.10.4)) that includes:
                (15.5.6.3.1.1) A back arrow in the top left corner of the window. 
                    (15.5.6.3.1.1.1) Default icon state uses ic_back.xml.
                    (15.5.6.3.1.1.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080.
                    (15.5.6.3.1.1.3) When activated the list collection editor window closes.
                        (15.5.6.3.1.1.3.1) The user returns to the main settings window.
                (15.5.6.3.1.2) A close button in the top right corner of the window.
                    (15.5.6.3.1.2.1) Default icon state uses ic_close.xml.
                    (15.5.6.3.1.2.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080.
                    (15.5.6.3.1.2.3) When activated all settings related windows close.
                (15.5.6.3.1.3) Below the back arrow and close button are the following menu option strings:
                    (15.5.6.3.1.3.1) "None"
                        (15.5.6.3.1.3.1.1) This is the default state.
                    (15.5.6.3.1.3.2) "Two Columns"
                    (15.5.6.3.1.3.3) "3✖3 Grid"
                    (15.5.6.3.1.3.4) "6✖6 Grid"
                    (15.5.6.3.1.3.5) "10✖10 Grid"
        (15.5.6.4) If any probability option other than "None" is selected, a probability chart opens where Announce typically appears.
            (15.5.6.4.1) "Two Columns" displays a two-column chart.
                (15.5.6.4.1.1) The string "Heads" appears on the left.
                (15.5.6.4.1.2) The string "Tails" appears on the right.
                    (15.5.6.4.1.2.1) It is aligned with "Heads" so they form a single row.
                (15.5.6.4.1.3) Heads and Tails are separated by a vertical line that runs the length of the display area.
                (15.5.6.4.1.4) A horizontal line separates Heads and Tails from the display area beneath them.
                (15.5.6.4.1.5) Following a flip, each coin is placed in its respective column based on its result.
                    (15.5.6.4.1.5.1) For example, the user flips 3b25 and 4mb2. The results are heads, heads, tails and tails, tails, tails, heads. Two b25 and 1mb2 coins would appear on the left, in the heads column, and 1n25 and 3mb2 would appear on the right, in the tails column.
                (15.5.6.4.1.6) The reset button clears all coins from the chart.
            (15.5.6.4.2) "3✖3 Grid" displays a grid of three columns and three rows (making a grid with nine boxes).
                (15.5.6.4.2.1) If a user taps the flip button, the result of that flip is displayed in the first open box.
                    (15.5.6.4.2.1.1) Boxes are ordered from top left, moving horizontally, and then wrapping to the next row, all the way to the final box in the bottom right.
                        (15.5.6.4.2.1.1.1) For example, if the first two boxes of the first row have been filled, the next flip will fill the third box of the top row. Another flip will fill the first box of the second row, and so on.
                    (15.5.6.4.2.1.2) Results are shown as H or T.
                        (15.5.6.4.2.1.2.1) If multiple coins are included, results are shown as #H/#T
                            (15.5.6.4.2.1.2.1.1) For example, if a user flips 2b25 and 4mb1 with results T, T, H, H, H, T, the box would show "3H/3T".
                            (15.5.6.4.2.1.2.1.2) If a result is entirely the same coin face (all heads or all tails), the side with no results is not displayed.
                            (15.5.6.4.2.1.2.1.3) For example, if a user flips 2b25 and 4mb1 with all results as heads, the box would show "6H".
                (15.5.6.4.2.2) If a user taps an empty box in the grid:
                    (15.5.6.4.2.2.1) a flip action is initiated for each empty box up to and including the one touched.
                        (15.5.6.4.2.2.1.1) For example, if no boxes are filled and the user taps the bottom right box, nine flips will occur.
                    (15.5.6.4.2.2.2) the result of each flip is listed sequentially, following the rules of (15.5.6.4.2.1.2).
                (15.5.6.4.2.3) If all boxes of the grid are full, the flip button can no longer be activated.
                (15.5.6.4.2.4) If coins are added to the coin pool while a grid is partially filled, these new coins add to the values displayed in all boxes filled in the future.
                (15.5.6.4.2.5) If the reset button is tapped, all grid boxes are cleared.
            (15.5.6.4.3) "6✖6 Grid" displays a grid of six columns and six rows (making a grid with 36 boxes).
                (15.5.6.4.3.1) This functions the same as (15.5.6.4.2) with more boxes available.
            (15.5.6.4.4) "10✖10 Grid" displays a grid of ten columns and ten rows (making a grid with 100 boxes).
                (15.5.6.4.4.1) This functions the same as (15.5.6.4.2) with more boxes available.


``GRAPH DISTRIBUTION``
		(15.5.7) "Graph Distribution" functions identically to (14.5.10), replacing dice with coins.
			(15.5.7.1) An x-axis would never have more than two intervals, one for heads and one for tails.
