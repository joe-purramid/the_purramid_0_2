The Purramid includes widgets that allow users to add each app-intent (except for About) to their home screen.


## Technical Implementation Notes
- Service/Activity type: Widget Provider (WidgetProvider) + Configuration Activity (WidgetConfigActivity)
- Multi-window support: Not applicable (home screen widgets)
- Instance tracking: Widget IDs managed by Android system
- Requires permissions: None
- Database entities: None (widget preferences stored by system)
- Key dependencies:
  - Special: Remote views for widget updates
  - Shared: Launcher images from mipmap resources

``LAUNCHER IMAGES``
(1) Each app-intent has a launcher image named (tp_*_launcher
    (1.1) For example, tp_timers_launcher.png
(2) Each app-intent launcher image has multiple versions to accommodate different resolutions.
    (2.1) Each of these is saved in a mipmap_* folder
        (2.1.1) For example, mipmap-mdpi.
