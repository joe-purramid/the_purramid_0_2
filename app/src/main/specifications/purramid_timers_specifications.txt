Timers are companion countdown timer and stopwatch. These appear only as digital clocks.

 --- RUNTIME EVENTS ---
(1) On first app-intent launch, the timer opens in a windowed state.
(2) The most recent timer user preferences are saved. Save the following:
	(2.1) Timer size
	(2.2) Background color
	(2.3) Set countdown time
	(2.4) Hundredths toggle state
	(2.5) Play Sound on Finish user definitions
	(2.6) User-defined music URLs
    (2.7) Lap toggle state
    (2.8) Sounds toggle state
(3) On future app-intent launches, the timer loads saved user preferences.


 --- USER INTERFACE ---
(4) A Settings button is positioned in the bottom left corner.
	(4.1) Default icon state uses ic_settings.xml.
	(4.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080.
(5) A Close button is positioned in the top right corner.
	(5.1) Default icon state uses ic_close.xml.
	(5.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080.
(6) All timers use a digital clock face HH:MM:SS
    (6.1) Hundredths will be abbreviated as cs (centiseconds) in the instructions, but all user-facing strings say Hundredths.
    (6.2) If Hundredths is toggled on, time displays as HH:MM:SS.cs
        (6.2.1) Hundredths appear 0.6f the size of the other numbers.
        (6.2.2) Hundredths are separated from seconds with a period not a colon.

``BUTTONS``
(7) Below the timer clock is two buttons:
	(7.1) Play/Pause
		(7.1.1) Default state: ic_pause.xml
		(7.1.2) Active state: ic_play.xml
	(7.2) Reset
		(7.2.1) Default state: ic_reset.xml
		(7.2.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080
	(7.3) Play/Pause is on the left, and Reset is on the right.
		(7.3.1) This order is reversed for right-to-left languages.

``NESTED``
(8) A nested timer:
    (8.1) is reduced in size, 75px by 75px
    (8.2) is affixed to the top right corner of the screen
        (8.2.1) This includes 20px of padding so that the timer does not appear flush against the edge
    (8.3) does not have any (7) control buttons visible.
    (8.4) can still be moved or resized by the user with dragging or pinching actions, like normal.
    (8.5) is stacked if multiple nested timers are added, with multiple timers in the top right corner of the screen 
		(8.5.1) Nested timers are are stacked one above the other, with the newest timer on the bottom.


 --- USER EXPERIENCE ---
(9) ``SETTINGS SUMMARY``
	(9.1) When a user touches the settings button
		(9.1.1) its icon changes from (4.1) Default to (4.2) Active.
		(9.1.2) time is paused if it is actively counting
	(9.2) When activated, a settings menu extends with a smooth transition animation from the settings button.
		(9.2.1) The settings button remains active while the settings window is open.
		(9.2.2) The settings window is rows of strings and an icon:
			(9.2.2.1) "Mode"
				(9.2.2.1.1) Following the word "Mode" are two icons:
					(9.2.2.1.1.1) A countdown icon
					(9.2.2.1.1.2) A stopwatch icon
				(9.2.2.1.2) The active mode has:
					(9.2.2.1.2.1) its fill programmatically changed to #808080
					(9.2.2.1.2.2) A thick blue bar beneath the icon
				(9.2.2.1.3) The default mode is (9.2.2.1.2.2) Countdown Timer
				(9.2.2.1.4) When a mode is activated, the UI changes to that timer type
			(9.2.2.2) "Colors"
				(9.2.2.2.1) Following the word "Color" is a color square
					(9.2.2.2.1.1) The fill for this square is the color current used for the timer background
					(9.2.2.2.1.2) The default color is White.
				(9.2.2.2.2) If the user taps the word "Color" or the color square, a color picker opens.
				(9.2.2.2.3) The color picker displays the six color options from PurramidPalette.kt
					(9.2.2.2.3.1) This color applies to the timer background
					(9.2.2.2.3.2) Timer numbers are either black and white depending on which option creates the best color contrast with the background color.
			(9.2.2.3) "Set Countdown"
				(9.2.2.3.1) This setting option is only visible if timer mode is set to Countdown Timer.
				(9.2.2.3.2) Following the phrase "Set Countdown" is an edit button
					(9.2.2.3.2.1) Default state: ic_edit.xml
					(9.2.2.3.2.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080
				(9.2.2.3.3) If the user taps the phrase "Set Countdown" or the edit button
					(9.2.2.3.3.1) the current time is displayed with all zeroes present for HH:MM:SS
						(9.2.2.3.3.1.1) For example, if time was 30:00, time would display as 00:30:00 when Set Countdown is open.
					(9.2.2.3.3.2) an up arrow appears above each numeral of HH:MM:SS
					(9.2.2.3.3.3) a down arrow appears below each numeral of HH:MM:SS
					(9.2.2.3.3.4) three circular buttons appear below the down arrows
						(9.2.2.3.3.4.1) a +1:00:00 button is centered between the two HH arrows
						(9.2.2.3.3.4.2) a +5:00 button is centered between the two MM arrows
						(9.2.2.3.3.4.3) a +0:30 button is centered between the two SS arrows
					(9.2.2.3.3.5) No arrows appear above or below centiseconds even if that setting is toggled on
					(9.2.2.3.3.6) If the user swipes a number 
						(9.2.2.3.3.6.1) upward
							(9.2.2.3.3.6.1.1) that number counts down in a smooth animation
							(9.2.2.3.3.6.1.2) the longer the swipe, the greater the change in numbers
						(9.2.2.3.3.6.2) downward
							(9.2.2.3.3.6.2.1) that number counts up in a smooth animation
							(9.2.2.3.3.6.2.2) the longer the swipe, the greater the change in numbers
						(9.2.2.3.3.6.3) If a user swipes again before the first animation completes, that animation continues until all swipes have been accounted for.
						(9.2.2.3.3.6.4) If the time change adds or subtracts an increment, that change is reflected in the time shown
							(9.2.2.3.3.6.4.1) For example, a user swipes down on the "tens second" numeral. When the number goes from 5 to 0, one minute is added to the "ones minute" numeral
					(9.2.2.3.3.7) If the user press-hold-drags a number, the behavior is the same as (9.2.2.3.3.6) except time changes only one number at a time.
				(9.2.2.3.3) The maximum time that can be set is 99:59:59.00
			(9.2.2.4) "Hundredths"

				(9.2.2.4.4) If the setting is toggled off, hundredths are not included in the displayed time
			(9.2.2.5) "Play Sound on Finish"
				(9.2.2.5.1) This setting option is only visible if timer mode is set to Countdown Timer.

					(9.2.2.5.2.2) The drop-down arrow's active state is ic_arrow_drop_up.xml
				(9.2.2.5.3) If the user taps the word "Mode" or the drop-down arrow
					(9.2.2.5.3.1) A horizontal drop-down menu opens with a smooth animation.
						(9.2.2.5.3.1.1) The menu displays a "sounds" button and a "music" button
							(9.2.2.5.3.1.1.1) "Sounds" displays a list of sounds available on the device
							(9.2.2.5.3.1.1.2) "Music" displays the (9.2.2.6) Music URL interface

						(9.2.2.6.2.4.1) The most recently used URL is on top
						(9.2.2.6.2.4.2) The least recently used URL is on bottom
						(9.2.2.6.2.4.3) If the user taps one of these URLs
							(9.2.2.6.2.4.3.1) it moves to the top of the three URL list
							(9.2.2.6.2.4.3.2) the URL text is added to the text field.
						(9.2.2.6.2.4.4) If the user adds a new music URL to the (9.2.2.6.2.3.2) text field, it will appear on the top of these three URLs the next time the user opens the settings.
					(9.2.2.6.2.5) If the user opens the Music URL setting after having added a URL previously during this app-intent active session, the URL appears
