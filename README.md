The claim that AI has replaced software developers is common on LinkedIn. While I've worked many years beside software developers as a product manager, I have no experience working in Kotlin directly.
As such, I felt I would be the perfect case study to see how well a person without coding experience can create and implement an Android app.
I am working almost entirely in Gemini (free), with the occasional trip to ChatGPT/Dall-E for art reproduction.
All art in this application are transformations of art that I own.
